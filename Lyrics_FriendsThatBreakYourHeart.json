Hmm\nIf I'm an animal\nShouldn't I be embracing it? Hmm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you're with me\nI feel like I'm embracing it\nAnd when you cry (When you cry)\nI know that you've been saving me, from me\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd if I'm insecure\nHow have I been so sure\nThat I'm gonna care for you\n'Til I am no more\nHow have I been so sure\nThat I'm gonna care for you\n'Til I am no more\nIf I'm insecure\nHow have I been so sure\nThat I'm gonna care for you\n'Til I am no more\nHow have I been so sure\nThat I'm gonna care for you\n'Til I am no more"
