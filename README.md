## SPICED Academy /// Week 04 /// Web scraping and text processing<br><br>
Within the forth week of SPICED Academy, I applied a text classifier (using Naive Bayes) that predicts the probability of a song being rightously classified to a certain artist. In concrete, the albums "Friends that break your heart" (by James Blake) and "Circles" (by Mac Miller) were compared. The lyrics were retrieved from Genius using an API Token.
